% Section 6.6: Image Subtraction

\subsection{Image Subtraction}

\subsubsection{Implementation in Framework}

Two major framework ({\tt afw}) improvements facilitated the
implementation of {\tt ip\_diffim} for DC3a, both coming about due to
the removal of {\tt Vision Workbench} from the software stack.  The
first was the replacement of the {\tt VW} pixel access operations,
while the second was the adoption of the {\tt Eigen} package for
linear algebra operations.  

The Applications Framework ({\tt afw}) release version 3.1 included the first stable
release of the new pixel accessor and iterator functionality.  The entirety of the  {\tt ip\_diffim} 
C++ code base had to be updated to use this new API.  

The {\tt Eigen} matrix math library was adopted due to its speed and templated nature.  Compared to the {\tt VW} matrix
math operations, its faster



\subsubsection{Speed Ups}

Specialized convolution by delta--function kernels, as well as overall caching improvement in the convolution.  Eigen
is also way faster.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Improvements}

The major improvement in the {\tt ip_diffim} package over DC2 was in designing an infrastructure for
the spatial modelling of the Kernel.  The SpatialCell class divides the image up into a grid, and attempts
to build a single Kernel model for each Cell by choosing the brightest object to build a Kernel around.  
If that model turns out to be inadequate (i.e. the resulting difference image is noisier than expected), 
another object is used in the modelling.  This process is repeated until a good Kernel is found, or all objects are 
deemed to be inadequate, in which case the Cell is considered ``empty''.  In this way we generate
an even grid of constraints of the Kernel model across the image, which will facitlitate the creation of the spatial Kernel model.
The spatial fitting is now itegrated closely with the SpatialCell class, iterating over all Cells and using their respective
models as constraints on the Kernel.  


Growing the Footprints by the right size.

Decrease the number of eigen Kernels.

\subsubsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Future Work}

Setting the Kernel size based on the Psf FWHM.

Further investigation of the convolution vs. deconvolution kernel issue is warranted.  Using the {\tt SimDeep} dataset, we
have determined that the derived Kernels are far noisier than expected even when the process is known to be a smoothing convolution.
The Kernels are far less self--similar than expected; consequently their spatial modelling will be difficult.

The SpatialCell functionality was initially written for fitting of the {\tt ip\_diffim} convolution Kernel.  However, it was subsequetly rewritten in a more advanced
form for modelling of the spatially varying Point Spread Function.  A task post--DC3a is to update the {\tt ip\_diffim} to use this
newer SpatialCell functionality.
