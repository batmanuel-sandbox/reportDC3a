\subsection{CFHT-LS Deep Survey Data}

32 CCDs.

\subsubsection{Science Data Products}

The ``raw'' archival science data from CFHT have actually gone through
a modicum of processing by the CFHT {\tt ELIXIR}
pipeline\footnote{\url{http://cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Imaging/MegaPrime/rawdata.html}}.
In particular, the two amplifier readouts were spliced back together
into 2112 by 4644 pixel images corresponding to a single CCD.  We need
to undo this operation to some degree, while still maintaining
consistency between the valid data sections, overscan regions, and
approximate Wcs information in the image headers.

For DC3a processing, we turned each of the 32 CCD images into 8 images
that are approximately the anticipated size of LSST amplifier images.
Synthesized amplifier images 0-3 come from image subsection {\tt
[0:1056,0:4612]} of the input images, and amplifier images 4-7 from
{\tt [1056:2112,0:4612]} (there is an additional overscan region from
$4612 \leq y \leq 4644$ that is ignored).  Each resulting amplifier
image is 1056 x 1153 pixels, with 32 pixels of overscan implemented as
``prescan'' (amplifiers 0-3) or ``postscan'' (amplifiers 4-7).  When
segmenting the images, we adjust the following Metadata keywords :

% NOTE - I coped these sections straight out of 
% prepdc3a/python/stageCfhtForDc3a.py.  Unfortunately
% these data sections end up being a mix of python slicing 
% (0-indexed) and IRAF/FITS convention (1-indexed).  How did I 
% deal with the fact that the sections are originally defined 
% in this convention?  This is dealt with in Isr.cc, BBoxFromDatasec.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt RDNOISE} : Each amplifier has a different amount of
readnoise.  In the spliced CFHT CCD image, these are recorded as {\tt
RDNOISEA} and {\tt RDNOISEB}.  For our segmented amplifier images we
assign {\tt RDNOISE} as either {\tt RDNOISEA} (amplifiers 0-3) or {\tt
RDNOISEB} (amplifiers 4-7).

\item {\tt GAIN} : Derived from {\tt GAINA} and {\tt GAINB} in a
manner similar to the {\tt RDNOISE} field.

\item {\tt BIASSEC} : This is set to either columns {\tt [1:32,]} (amps
0-3) or {\tt [1025:1056,]} (amps 4-7).

\item {\tt DATASEC} and {\tt TRIMSEC} : This is set to either columns
{\tt [33:1056,]} (amps 0-3) or {\tt [1:1024,]} (amps 4-7).

\item {\tt CRPIX1} : This is left as--is for amps 0-3, and corrected
by -1023 pixels for amps 4--7.  Additionally, for CCDs 1--16, amps
0--3 are adjusted by another -33 pixels, and for CCDs 17--32 amps 4--7
are adjusted by another -33 pixels.  This reflects the exclusion of a
secondary overscan region at the ``top'' or ``bottom'' of the CCD,
depending on the orientation of the CCD on the focal plane.

\item {\tt CRPIX2} : This is adjusted by the y--axis offset of each
amplifier image from the original CCD image.

\end{itemize}

The visitId associated with each Image comes from the Metadata keyword
{\tt OBSID}, while we assume that this image represents the first
exposure (exposureId = 0) of the cosmic ray split.  The segmented
files are saved on disk as Images using the following formatting :
{\tt 'raw-\%06d-e\%03d-c\%03d-a\%03d.fits' \% (visitId, exposureId,
ccdId, ampId)}

The second exposure of the visit is synthesized by taking the actual
CFHT image and adding a set of cosmic rays.  This is saved to disk
using the above formatting, with exposureId = 1.
