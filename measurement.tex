\subsection{Source Measurement}

Source measurement occurs only in the context of an image, thus 
\code{MeasureSources} - a set of centroid, shape, and photometry measurement 
algorithms - is constructed from an \code{Exposure}; it is templated over 
\code{Exposure}'s pixel type. \code{MeasureSources}  acts as the driver behind
the generalized \code{Footprint} iterator \code{FootprintFunctor} in applying 
its set of algorithms to a \code{Footprint} over the \code{Exposure}. 
Which algorithms to use can be specified by name in a \code{Policy} file.
