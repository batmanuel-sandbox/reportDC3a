\subsection{Operational Issues}


Database authorization was reworked. It was non-existent in DC2:
everybody was allowed to do anything. In DC3a we tighten
authorization: introduced scheme where each user had her/his
own ``namespace'': each user is granted full access to
her/his databases, and read-only access to other databases.
An administrative tool for granting lsst-specific
privileges for new users was written.


We also introduced metadata about runs. This allows us
to easily related databases with runs, and cleanup old
or obsolete runs based on different criteria such as
creation time or run owner.


Database setup scripts were reworked. A thin layer between
the database and the admin scripts was introduced to contain
the code directly interacting with the database. This will
simplify migration to other database technology, should
this become necessary in the future. The database setup
scripts were also integrated with policies.
