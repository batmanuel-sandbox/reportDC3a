% section 5.2: Database Schema Modifications

\subsection{Database Schema Modifications since DC2}


MOPS schema was integrated into the master copy of the
LSST baseline schema (in Enterprise Architect). The 
integration include realigning names, units, and 
merging tables where appropriete.


Amplifier-level exposure metadata was introduced
in addition to the ccd- and fpa-level metadata which 
was already present in DC2.


SDQA related schema has been introduced, this is 
covered in details in the SDQA section.


Schema for capturing provenance related to policies
has been introduced.


The whole schema has been refactored to cleanup types
and to realign it with the LSST naming convensions.


Schema for the Object, Source and DIASource tables 
has been modified to reflect the new needs of the 
transient application classes.


\subsubsection {Schema browser}

Schema browser was built and deployed, the url is
http://dev.lsstcorp.org/schema/. This graphical, web-based
browser allows quick, easy and convenient way to look
at the database schema structure, including browsing tables, 
column names, their types, units, UCDs and descriptions.
Decriptions and units for most columns has been added,
the UCD fields are empty.

This work include expanding the master copy of the schema 
in EA to capture information about units, UCDs and description
per-column. A script has been writen to translete this 
information into format readable by schema browser. 
This allows us to manage all the information about the schema 
in one central place (EA) in database-agnostic form.
